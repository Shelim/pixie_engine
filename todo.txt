Process
 - Made default runners (runner_sync, runner_spawn, runner_pool)
	into custom class and instance it in processes_t
		-> additional thread inside processes for spawn/pool
 - More verbose logs!
 - Debug!
 - Runners should be registered with tags (to ease passing their names)
 - Remove std::thread usage outside of process_t
