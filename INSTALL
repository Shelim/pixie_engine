Currently only WINDOWS is supported for developing.

BEFORE DOING ANYTHINGE ELSE:
	Use download_dependencies.bat to download all depedencies.
	You will need to call this ONLY ONCE after project's checkout

Then:
	- Use open_documentation.bat to read docs, or
	- Jump into developing by calling new_project.bat
	
All scripts are interactive and can be run directly from Windows Explorer.
